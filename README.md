# Mind Games Project
“Mind Games” is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that must be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Wrong answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. Games:
- Determining an even number.
- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
- Determining the greatest common divisor.
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Determining a prime number.

### Start the game
To start the game, please type the following command in the console:
```
